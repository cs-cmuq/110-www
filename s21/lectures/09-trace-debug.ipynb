    "Debugging is basically tracing your program in your head (often with the help of some pen and paper) for some particular input, and finding out where and why it fails. Obviously you should choose an input that makes your program fail, but something small enough so that you don't need to run too many steps until failing. Your input should be **as simple as possible and as complicated as necessary**.\n",
