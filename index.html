      <img class="img-thumbnail float-right ml-4" style="margin-top: 50px; width:350px" alt="CS quote" src="cover-o.png">
      <p class="text-justify">
      <h2><b>Overview</b></h2>

      <p class="text-justify">
        <i>Computing</i> can be defined as the study of computational
        processes that manipulate information. A <i>computational
        process</i> is one that can be automated, and thus executed by a
        computer. Therefore, one of the main underlying questions is:
        <b>what can be (efficiently) automated?</b>
        This course aims at introducing the science (and the art) of
        computing to students with little or no prior background in
        this subject.
      </p>
        
      <p class="text-justify">
        Given the great amount of topics involved in
        computing, the course will focus on a subset of its core
        aspects, providing a brief, yet substantial introduction to
        many concepts. The goal is to provide an idea of what can be
        automated, and how to realize when it is useful (or, most often,
        necessary) to employ computation and computers to accomplish a
        complex goal.  
      </p>

      <p class="text-justify">
        The course will take the student along the way that starts
        from a complex, possibly large problem to solve, and then move
        step by step to its <i>abstraction</i>, to its formalization into an
        <i>algorithmic recipe</i>, to the encoding of the algorithm using the
        <i>constructs of the python language</i>, to the run-time
        <i>execution</i> and <i>error correction</i> of the
        programming code, to the <i>efficiency analysis</i> of the
        developed algorithm and code. 
      </p>

      <h2><b>Learning goals</b></h2>
      
      <p class="text-justify">
        <ul>
          <li> Understand what classes of problems computers are good at or are necessary for. </li>
          <li> Be able to analyze and abstract a given problem in a way which is amenable
               to an algorithmic solution. </li>
          <li> Design algorithmic solutions. </li>
          <li> Judge the effectiveness of an algorithmic solution, and ways to improve it. </li>
          <li> Apply fundamental algorithmic solution techniques when
               relevant. </li>
          <li> Code algorithmic solutions in Python. </li>
          <li> Debug and test Python code. </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p class="text-justify">
        The Python constructs introduced throughout the course
        include, but are not limited to:
        <ul>
          <li> Basic datatypes (integer, strings, booleans, floating
          point numbers) </li>
          <li> Arithmetic operations </li>
          <li> Conditionals </li>

      <h2><b>Homework Assignments</b></h2>
        
      <h3>Getting the Assignments</h3>
      <p>
        The writeup and starter files for each homework will be posted in
        <a href="">Autolab</a> on Thursdays (the availability of the files will be announced on
	<a href="https://piazza.com/class/ljlg79kg2vc4sb" target="_blank">Piazza</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        We <b>strongly</b> suggest that you create one folder for each
        assignment inside a folder dedicated for this course on your
        machine. Submissions containing code from previous
        assignments, or old code from the current assignment will not
        be reconsidered.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h3>Homework Grading</h3>

      <p>
	<b>Each homework will be graded in two parts,</b> one based on the autograding, and one based on
	<span class="text-danger"><b>homework interviews carried out by the Course Assistants during
	the weekly meetings scheduled with the students.</b></span> All the autograded scores will
	weight for the 8% of the final grade, while the scores from the interviews will weight for
	the 10% of the final grade. The modality for grading the two parts is discussed below.</p>
	
      
      <h3>Submitting the Assignments for Autograding</h3>

      <p>
        You will need to submit a <code>.py</code> (or a <code>zip</code>) file 
        containing your solution.
      </p>

      <p>
        The file with your solution will have to be submitted to
        <a href="">Autolab</a>.
        It will immediately run a series of tests on your code and give you a
        score with some feedback. Make sure to check it! If your code does not
        pass all tests, you can submit it again until the deadline. <span
        class="text-danger"><b>You are limited to a total of 10 submissions
        for each assignment.</b></span> 
      </p>

      <p>
        The score received on Autolab may not reflect your final score for the assignment that will
        be shown in Autolab, since the course staff will check the code
        for <a href="resources/style.pdf">style</a> and for code similarity between students, to
        ensure that you are not violating rules of academic integrity.
      </p>

      
      <h3>Homework Interviews</h3>

      <p>
        After submitting the homework, the course staff will conduct interviews to evaluate your
        understanding of the solutions. The interview will be carried out during the (mandatory!)
        weekly meeting that thet student will have scheduled with her/his CA Tutor. During the
        interview, one of the homework tasks will be randomly chosen and you will have to solve it
        live. Each interview will take at most 15 minutes.</p>

      <p>
	The rubric for evaluating the interviews with a grade score between 0 and 100 is as follows:

      <ol>
      <li> Code is mostly incomplete or incorrect, explanation does not show understanding of what
      is going on: 0 &lt; score &le; 20  </li>
      <li> Code and logic are only partially correct, explanation does not show a solid understanding of
      what is going on:  20 &lt; score &le; 40 </li>
      <li> Code is more or less correct, still with some errors, explanation is not fully
      satisfactory: 40 &lt; score &le; 60 </li>
      <li> Code looks good, minor issues, little misunderstandings in the explanation: 60 &lt; score &le; 80 </li>
      <li> Code is basically correct, clear and didactic explanation: 80 &lt; score &le; 100   </li>
      </ol>
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="text-danger"><b>If the student doesn't meet with the tutoring CA for the
      interview during the week, the homework grade for the interview part will be 0.</b></span>
      </p>

      <p>
	Note that IF your submitted homework systematically achieves a high grade, while your
	performance at the interview is systematically very bad, this will naturally raise up a
	warning in terms of <span class="text-danger"><b>violation of academic integrity </b></span>
	(you are clearly receiving an authorized help for the homework submission!)

	
      The course staff might also ask for small variations of a problem to gauge understanding. In
      particular, we encourage you to not be afraid to say wrong things, you can always correct
      yourself!
      </p>

      <p>
	Together with writing the code, you should also strive for a clear, concise, and didactic
      explanation of the solution logic.  Think that you are explaining your solution to someone who
      is one month behind you in this course.
      </p>

      <h4>Rules of Conduct</h4>

      <p>
      <ul>
        <li> You cannot consult extra material, it is only you and your brain. </li>
        <li> You can ask clarification questions, but we might not answer if they give away the solution. </li>

      We will run a program that detects code similarity on all your homework

      <h3>An Invitation to Students with Learning Disabilities:</h3>
      <p>
      Carnegie Mellon University is committed to providing reasonable
      accommodations for all persons with disabilities. To access
      accommodation services you are expected to initiate the request and
      submit a Voluntary Disclosure of Disability Form to the office of Health
      &amp; Wellness or CaPS-Q. In order to receive services/accommodations,
      verification of a disability is required as recommended in writing by a
      doctor, licensed psychologist or psycho-educational specialist. The
      office of Health &amp; Wellness, CaPS-Q and Office of Disability Resources
      in Pittsburgh will review the information you provide. All information
      will be considered confidential and only released to appropriate persons
      on a need to know basis.
      </p>
      <p> 
      Once the accommodations have been approved, you will be issued a Summary
      of Accommodations Memorandum documenting the disability and describing
      the accommodation. You are responsible for providing the Memorandum to
      your professors at the beginning of each semester.
      </p><br>
      
      <h3>Take Care of Yourself:</h3>
      <p>
      Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating
      well, exercising, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax.
      This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.
      </p>
      <p>
      All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not
      alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an
      important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for
      help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.
      </p>
      <p>
      If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult
      life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly
      encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services
      (CaPS-Q) is here to help: call 4454 8525 or make an appointment to see
      the counselor by emailing 
      <a href="mailto:student-counselling@qatar.cmu.edu">student-counselling@qatar.cmu.edu</a>. 
      Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust
      for help.
      </p>
      <p> 
      If you or someone you know is feeling suicidal or in danger of
      self-harm, call someone immediately, day or night at 5554 7913.  If the
      situation is life threatening, call 999.</p>
